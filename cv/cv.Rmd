aboutme: "I specialise in making complex models more transparent, understandable and explainable. It's fascinating that statistics is used in every industry and scientific field, but so much of it is unintuitive and misinterpreted. Iâ€™ve recently been publishing papers on new machine learning methods, and applying them to a number of impactful real-world problems. To make my research accessible, I write useful software packages and libraries in R, Python and Julia. I serve as a council member and Early Career and Student Statisticians' Representative at the Statistical Society of Australia."
